    <p>Once upon a time....in a classroom far far away      
    in Napier University a student was studying web tech
    <p>and was asked to create a quiz by his loyal lecturer
      Simon Wells....so the student Andrew Hack 40457712</p>
    </p>created a Star Wars Battle Quiz and the aim of the
    quiz was to add features to a plain quiz to make the quiz</p>
    <p>fun and entainening, this was done using the Rebel Alliance
      and the Imperial Dark forces aposing each other in a
      battle in the form of a Star Wars Battle Quiz.</p>
    <p>Good versus Evil to restore freedom to the galaxy!</p>
